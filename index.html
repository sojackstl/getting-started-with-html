    <b>What is the internet?</b><br>
The internet is a series of communications between a person, a pc, a connection and servers. 
When a person types in a website link, like <a href="www.cnn.com">CNN</a> it sends a HTTP request
to a server. The server then returns to the user with the appropriate
HTML file so that the user can view this document.<p></p>
<b>HTML</b><br> HTML is the language of the internet. It is made up of several components. The first is the text content, which is what you see.
The second is the markup, which is what it looks like. The third is references to other pages. The fourth and final piece is references to other websites.<p>
</p><b>Markup</b><br> Markups are tags that make webpages look the way they do. Tags looks like < name > content < / name > and when entered correctly effect the way that the user views the page.</name>
One type of tag is the tag for <b>bold</b>, it looks like < b > </ b >.
Another such tag is the one for <em>italics,</em> that tag looks like < em > < / em >. It is important to note that tags end with a "/". <p></p>
<b>HTML Attributes</b><br>
These allow you to add things to your HTML document that the user sees. The first type of attribute is those that allow links to be used.
This tag looks like < a href=>. It allows you to link websites like <a href="www.espn.com">ESPN</a> to your document. Another attribute is that for images. This, as the name would suggest, allows you to put images onto your webpage.
The tag looks like < img src=>, and an example is <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/St_Louis_Cardinals_Cap_Insignia.svg/203px-St_Louis_Cardinals_Cap_Insignia.svg.png" alt="sorry couldn't load">. As you can see, I have loaded an image of the best baseball team in America to my webpage. 
The last few attributes I would like to discuss are ones that effect whitespace. These tags can effect lines like < br >, which simply starts a new line. This is called an inline attribute. They can also create an imaginarty "box" around text with the < p > tag that has a height and width.
These are called "block" elements.
